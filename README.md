VibratingTimer
==============
It vibrates your phone to tell you the time.

It is configurable so that:
- Every few minutes it vibrates once
- Every few minutes it vibrates twice
- Every few minutes it performs a long vibration

This way, if you don't have a watch, but you don't want to pull out your phone, you can still keep track of time in your pocket.
